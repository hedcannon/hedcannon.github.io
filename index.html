<p.a>James Gaston Wynn</p.a>
<p.a>(512) 698-9178</p.a>
<p.a><a href="mailto:wynn.james@gmail.com">wynn.james@gmail.com</a></p.a>
<p>I have over 25 years of experience as a Business Analyst and Technical Writer, creating user manuals, knowledgebase guides, 
    administrator guides, API references, online help, animated online demos, business analysis to develop use cases, 
    UML/BPM workflow diagrams and decks, and requirements documentation.</p>
<p>I have led teams of writers and served as a mentor to junior writers.</p>

<p>I am capable of operating as a peer of the development, QA, and management team members to solve documentation and process-related problems 
    without hand-holding or constant direction. I can assess the necessary content for various communication channels, and also query code and 
    databases for that content without assistance.</p>

<p><em>I am not a coder.</em> I am at ease with querying the code and databases for configuration information. 
    I have also assisted developers in self-documenting their code. At my current position alone I have had 
    to switch from documenting Python to documenting Java. However, if routine scripting tasks and testing duties 
    are required to perform my job, I am confident I will be able to accommodate to the requirements of my position.</p>

<p>Currently I am the Product Owner and Solution Architect for an FX trading exposure-mitigation tool in the Financial industry. </p>

<p>I started at State Street as the senior technical writer for the Automation &amp; AI group. Afterward, I became, initially, 
    the Business Analyst, then Solution Architect and Product Owner of a new FX trading exposure-mitigation tool. In this role:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Wrote the narrative process descriptions, assigned development tasks and oversaw all Alpha testing.</li>
	<li>Developed original documentation, SQL reports, presentation decks and regular updates to management.</li>
	<li>Provided product support to users.</li>
</ul>
